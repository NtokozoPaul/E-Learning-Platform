# Reflection: Assignment 8

### Challenges:
- **Granularity**: Choosing when to stop decomposing states vs. keeping things readable.
- **Alignment**: Mapping state changes to real Agile user stories took thought. Some user stories spanned multiple objects or activities.
- **Clarity vs. Complexity**: Some workflows could be very detailed but risked becoming overwhelming.

### Learnings:
- **State diagrams** help clarify **how objects behave** over time (great for tracking lifecycle).
- **Activity diagrams** visualize **the process/workflow**â€”perfect for user flows.
- Both diagrams support Agile by revealing blockers and steps in delivery.
