# ðŸ”— Integration with Prior Work â€“ E-Learning Platform

This document outlines how the **current system** integrates with **prior work** (previous models, requirements, or systems) to ensure the **E-Learning Platform**'s workflows, processes, and functionality are compatible, scalable, and efficient.

## 1. User Account Integration

The **User Account Model** from prior work serves as the foundation for the registration, login, and management of user accounts in the E-Learning Platform. The registration workflow and account validation logic integrate seamlessly with:
- **Account Management System (AMS)** for email verification and password recovery.
- **Learning Management System (LMS)** for linking user profiles with course enrollment data.

**Integration Points:**
- The **Email Verification Process** integrates with the **AMS** to ensure accounts are authenticated before allowing course enrollment.
- **Role Management** is tied to account statuses (Active, Suspended, Deactivated) and is used for access control across the platform.

**Traceability:**
- **FR-001**: Account management features are consistent with the **User Registration** workflow from prior work.
- **US-002**: User registration integrates with the **LMS** for learner profiles.

## 2. Course Management Integration

The **Course Model** integrates with prior course creation and management processes, linking new workflows with existing systems:
- **Instructor Dashboards** provide access to manage, publish, and review course content, drawing from legacy systems for easy course duplication and templating.
- **Course Lifecycle** (from Draft to Published) uses the legacy **Content Review System** to ensure each course undergoes quality checks before being made available to learners.

**Integration Points:**
- Existing **Course Content Database** is linked to new courses to preserve historical course content and make it easy for instructors to reuse and modify previous courses.
- The **Publishing Workflow** integrates with the legacy **Course Repository** to ensure no overlap with archived content.

**Traceability:**
- **FR-002**: Course creation process follows the steps laid out in prior systems with new features for approval and publishing.
- **US-005**: Instructors can publish courses directly through the **Instructor Dashboard**, seamlessly integrating with past workflows.

## 3. Enrollment and Course Tracking Integration

The **Enrollment System** integrates with past course registration and learner tracking workflows to ensure that learner progress is tracked across multiple platforms:
- **Payment Gateway Integration** ensures smooth transitions from payment processing to active course enrollment.
- Learner progress is updated automatically in both the new system and legacy tracking tools.

**Integration Points:**
- The **Payment Gateway** links to the prior work's **Financial Systems** for real-time payment verification and user notifications.
- **Enrollment Data** is shared between the **LMS** and **Learning Record Store (LRS)**, ensuring cross-platform tracking of learner engagement and completion.

**Traceability:**
- **FR-004**: Course enrollment and progress is tracked consistently with prior work to ensure accurate data on learners.
- **US-006**: Learners' enrollment data syncs between old systems and the new E-Learning Platform.

## 4. Assignment and Submission Integration

The **Assignment Workflow** builds upon the legacy assignment management system, ensuring the submission, grading, and feedback processes are standardized and compatible:
- The **Assignment Creation and Grading System** integrates with the previous **Instructor Feedback Database**, enabling instructors to provide detailed feedback.
- **Submission Tracking** is shared between legacy systems and the new platform for consistency in grading and deadline enforcement.

**Integration Points:**
- **Legacy Assignment Database** is queried for prior assignments, which are reused in the new system.
- **Feedback Mechanism** for assignments integrates with prior systems for easy access to historical feedback.

**Traceability:**
- **FR-005**: Assignment publishing and feedback is integrated with the older assignment system to maintain a seamless process.
- **US-008**: The assignment and grading workflows are consistent with legacy systems for ease of use.

## 5. Quiz System Integration

The **Quiz Workflow** in the new system integrates with past quiz systems to provide seamless transitions for quizzes, grading, and reporting:
- **Quiz Attempt Data** is synchronized between the new system and prior quiz systems, allowing instructors to access detailed reports of past quiz attempts.
- **Grading System** uses **legacy grading algorithms** for consistency in scoring across the platform.

**Integration Points:**
- **Quiz Data** is stored in the previous **Question Bank** system, with new quizzes linked for reusability.
- **Results Reporting** integrates with legacy **Student Performance Dashboards** to display progress across both new and old platforms.

**Traceability:**
- **FR-007**: The quiz lifecycle is aligned with prior systems to ensure consistency in grading and reporting.
- **US-011**: Quizzes and results are managed across legacy and current platforms.

## 6. Support Ticket System Integration

The **Support Ticket System** integrates with previous helpdesk systems to streamline issue tracking and resolution:
- **Legacy Ticketing System** data is imported into the new platform to provide a complete history of past support requests.
- **Ticket Resolution Flow** ensures continuity
