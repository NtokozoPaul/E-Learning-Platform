### 🎯 Sprint Goal Statement:

This sprint aims to deliver the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for the E-Learning Platform. It focuses on enabling students to register, enroll in courses, view and submit assignments, and for instructors to upload learning materials. This functionality forms the essential learning workflow and addresses core stakeholder requirements around access, interaction, and learning progress. Including security ensures that even the MVP respects user data protection standards.
