# 💭 Reflection – Agile Planning as a Solo Stakeholder

Working as the sole stakeholder for this Agile sprint was both empowering and surprisingly difficult. Without external clients or users to negotiate with, the biggest challenge became negotiating with myself — my expectations, my ambition, and my need to stay focused and realistic.

### 🧩 Prioritization Struggles

Prioritizing the product backlog was harder than expected. Every feature felt important. From a user experience perspective, it was tempting to jump ahead to “nice-to-have” features like dashboards and analytics. But when I stepped into the role of the product owner and asked, “What is absolutely necessary for this system to function?”, I had to strip things back to the core: login, course enrollment, submitting assignments, and uploading content. Cutting features I was excited about felt like self-sabotage, but it was necessary to define a true MVP.

### ⏱️ Estimation Conflicts

Estimating effort without a team forced me to be brutally honest about my own capabilities and limitations. I wanted to believe I could build everything quickly, but when breaking down tasks like “Build Assignment Submission,” I realized how many moving parts were involved: form validation, file storage, backend integration, UI feedback, and user testing. Each one could take hours. The friction here wasn’t technical — it was emotional. I had to resist the urge to downplay the time needed just to feel more productive on paper.

### 🤝 Aligning Agile with Internal Resistance

Agile is all about responding to change and iteration based on feedback. But as a solo stakeholder, the only resistance I encountered was from within. It was easy to ignore problems or “approve” ideas without challenge, and that’s dangerous. To simulate real stakeholder conflict, I forced myself to role-play both sides: developer and stakeholder. When reviewing my own backlog, I questioned everything: “Is this story too vague? Is this testable? Will this move the product forward?” That back-and-forth dialogue helped me make better, more grounded decisions.

### 🔍 Self-Accountability

Without daily standups, retrospectives, or sprint reviews with a team, I had to create self-check-ins. The Sprint Goal was especially helpful — it became a filter I used for every task. If a user story didn’t contribute directly to that goal, I deferred it. Writing everything down in the sprint plan helped keep me honest. Even the task statuses reminded me that “Done” doesn’t mean “perfect,” just “meets the goal.”

### 🎯 Takeaway

Being my own stakeholder highlighted how easy it is to either overestimate myself or let scope creep in unnoticed. The biggest lesson? Agile only works when you’re willing to challenge your own assumptions — even when you’re the only one in the room.

This reflection isn’t just about what I built; it’s about how I learned to think more critically, plan more honestly, and lead myself through uncertainty using Agile principles.
