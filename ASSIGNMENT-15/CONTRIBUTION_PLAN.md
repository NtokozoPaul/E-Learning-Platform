## ðŸ§  Contribution Strategy

1. **Start Small**  
   Begin with documentation fixes or frontend UI tweaks. These are simple and help build confidence in understanding the codebase.

2. **Pick Labeled Issues**  
   Only select issues that are clearly labeled (`good-first-issue`, `feature-request`, or `help-wanted`) to avoid working on something already claimed.

3. **Claim Issues Early**  
   I will comment on issues first to let maintainers and other contributors know I am working on them.

4. **Match Style & Structure**  
   I will read each projectâ€™s `CONTRIBUTING.md` to follow their coding standards, commit message rules, and testing approach.

5. **Test Everything**  
   If the project includes a CI pipeline, I will ensure that tests pass before submitting the PR.

6. **Stay Responsive**  
   I will watch for review comments on PRs and update them quickly to increase the chances of merging.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

I aim to make at least one meaningful contribution per project and engage in peer discussions where needed.
