# E-Learning-Platform

The E-Learning Platform Architecture Diagram illustrates how students, instructors, and admins interact with the system. It includes three levels: System Context, Container, and Component Diagrams. The backend handles course management, authentication, assessments, payments, and notifications. The system integrates with a database, payment gateway, and email/SMS services. Adding this Mermaid.js code to GitHub's ARCHITECTURE.md will generate a visual representation automatically.
