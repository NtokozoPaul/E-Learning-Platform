# Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Working on the E-Learning Platform revealed several challenges in balancing the needs of different stakeholders. While each group had valid and important concerns, their priorities sometimes conflicted, requiring trade-offs and compromises.

One key challenge was ensuring system **usability for students** while maintaining high **performance** for IT support. Students preferred rich media content like high-resolution videos and interactive elements, but this increased load times and affected overall platform responsiveness. We addressed this by implementing content compression and CDN delivery to improve performance without sacrificing user experience.

Another challenge arose between **instructors and administrators**. Instructors wanted flexibility in uploading content and designing their own grading rubrics, but administrators required standardization for compliance and analytics. To strike a balance, we created templates that instructors could customize within defined limits.

There was also tension between **security and convenience**. For example, the finance team and parents wanted simple payment processes, but IT required multi-step verification and encryption protocols to ensure data security. We resolved this by integrating a secure payment API (Stripe) that also supported one-click checkout for trusted users.

Lastly, **maintainability** was important for developers and IT staff, who wanted modular code and detailed documentation, while other stakeholders were unaware of the importance of these backend practices. Ensuring maintainability without affecting delivery timelines required careful planning and time allocation.

In conclusion, the process taught me that successful systems require more than just functionalityâ€”they need to reflect a thoughtful balance of user experience, technical feasibility, and operational sustainability. Agile practices like user stories and iterative feedback helped manage these competing needs effectively.
