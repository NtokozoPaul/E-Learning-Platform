## Why Branch Protection Rules Matter

Branch protection rules are essential for maintaining the stability, quality, and security of the main codebase. Here's why these rules are enforced:

### 1. Require Pull Request Reviews
This ensures that at least one other team member reviews changes before they are merged. It prevents unintentional bugs and promotes collaboration.

### 2. Require Status Checks to Pass
By integrating automated tests (CI), we ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality. A failed test prevents merging, enforcing code correctness.

### 3. Disable Direct Pushes
Preventing direct pushes forces all changes to go through a pull request, ensuring review and testing steps are not bypassed.

### 4. Enabling for All Contributors
Including administrators and restricting who can push ensures consistency and avoids accidental override of policies.

These rules collectively improve code quality, minimize bugs, and enforce a culture of accountability and best practices within the development team.
