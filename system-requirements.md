## 1. Functional Requirements

The following functional requirements define what the system should do. Critical requirements include acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and testability.

| **ID** | **Functional Requirement**                                                                                  | **Acceptance Criteria**                                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR1    | The system shall allow users to register and log in using email/password or social media credentials.       | Users with valid credentials can log in successfully.                                    |
| FR2    | The system shall support role-based access for Students, Instructors, and Administrators.                   | Each user only accesses features permitted by their role.                                |
| FR3    | The system shall allow instructors to create, edit, and delete courses.                                     | Instructors can manage course content and changes reflect immediately.                   |
| FR4    | The system shall allow uploading of course materials including PDFs, videos, and quizzes.                   | Uploaded content appears under the relevant course section.                              |
| FR5    | The system shall allow students to enroll in available courses.                                              | Students can enroll and view enrolled courses on their dashboard.                        |
| FR6    | The system shall support automated grading of multiple-choice quizzes.                                       | Scores are displayed instantly after quiz submission.                                    |
| FR7    | The system shall allow manual grading and feedback by instructors.                                           | Instructors can assign scores and feedback, which is visible to students.                |
| FR8    | The system shall generate digital certificates for course completion when students meet grading criteria.    | Students can download a certificate upon achieving â‰¥70% in course assessments.           |
| FR9    | The system shall integrate with Stripe to allow secure payments for premium courses.                         | Successful/failed transactions are logged and users are notified.                        |
| FR10   | The system shall provide real-time push notifications for announcements, assignments, and grades.           | Notifications appear within 5 seconds of creation.                                       |
| FR11   | The system shall provide progress tracking dashboards for students and instructors.                          | Users can see progress bars, completion stats, and activity logs.                        |
| FR12   | The system shall allow admins to generate reports on user activity, engagement, and payments.                | Admins can export reports in CSV or PDF formats.                                         |

- NFR5: New modules must be independently deployable via microservices architecture.

### Scalability
- NFR6: The system shall support at least 1,000 concurrent users during peak hours without performance degradation.

### Security
- NFR7: All user passwords shall be encrypted using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 12.
- NFR8: All communication with the server shall be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).

### Performance
