# 🗂️ Custom Kanban Board – E-Learning Platform

## ✅ Customization Summary

A custom GitHub Project board was created using the **Automated Kanban** template to support Agile sprint planning and automation.

### 🔧 Custom Columns Added:
- **Testing**: Added to isolate tasks that are ready for QA or peer review.
- **Blocked**: Helps identify tasks waiting on dependencies or approvals.

### 🔁 Task Population
Tasks from the Sprint Plan in Assignment 6 were added as GitHub Issues and linked to the board.

### 🔖 Labels Used:
- `feature` – Used for new functionality (e.g., user login, course enrollment)
- `bug` – Used when tracking issues or blockers
- `enhancement` – Applied to progress-tracking features or optional improvements

### 👥 Assignments:
Tasks were assigned using `@` mentions to indicate ownership, e.g.,  
`@ntokozo-dev` assigned to `Build assignment submission form`.
