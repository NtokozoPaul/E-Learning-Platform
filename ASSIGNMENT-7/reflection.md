# ðŸ’­ Reflection â€“ Project Template Selection and Customization

Choosing and customizing a GitHub Project template for this assignment was more involved than expected. Although GitHub provides ready-made templates like Basic Kanban and Automated Kanban, the real challenge was understanding how their built-in workflows align with Agile practices.

One of the main difficulties was the **limited flexibility in layout and WIP (Work-in-Progress) settings**. Unlike tools like **Trello**, GitHub doesnâ€™t let you set hard WIP limits directly in the UI, so you must manually enforce them or rely on good habits.

When customizing the board, I found that **Automated Kanban** offered a great balance between structure and automation. However, it wasn't always intuitive. It required trial and error to figure out how issue events (e.g., closed, assigned) automatically moved cards. In contrast, **Jira** offers more refined control over automation rules, workflows, and swimlanes â€” which makes it better suited for large teams and complex projects.

GitHubâ€™s strengths lie in its **integration with repositories**. Creating issues directly from code, commits, or pull requests is seamless â€” a feature Trello lacks entirely. However, Trelloâ€™s **drag-and-drop simplicity** and visual clarity are more user-friendly for non-developers.

In summary, GitHubâ€™s templates are a solid starting point for developers working within the GitHub ecosystem. They may not match the advanced features of Jira or the simplicity of Trello, but for solo or small Agile teams, they offer just enough structure to manage sprints, track tasks, and stay aligned with Agile principles.
