## âœ… Justification for Selected Template

**Chosen Template**: `Automated Kanban`

**Why?**  
The **Automated Kanban** template is most aligned with the E-Learning Platform project because it supports sprint-based workflows with built-in automation. It automatically updates cards when issues are assigned, opened, or closed, reducing manual overhead. This makes it easier to focus on sprint goals and track progress accurately, which is crucial for managing timeboxed iterations and responding to changes.
