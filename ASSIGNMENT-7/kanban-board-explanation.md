# 🗂️ Kanban Board Explanation – E-Learning Platform

## What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a **visual project management tool** that organizes tasks into columns representing different stages of progress. It allows teams (or individuals) to track workflow, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve delivery.

## How Our Board Works

### 🔄 Visualizes Workflow

Our board includes the following columns:
- **To Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Testing**
- **Blocked**
- **Done**

Each task (issue) moves from left to right as it progresses through development. This makes it easy to track what is being worked on and what's complete.

### 🚧 Limits Work-In-Progress (WIP)

We limited WIP to **a maximum of 3 tasks per column** to reduce multitasking and avoid bottlenecks. This ensures focus and increases the chance of completing tasks before starting new ones.

### 🧠 Supports Agile Principles

- **Continuous Delivery**: Work is pulled into the board as capacity allows, encouraging a flow of completed tasks.
- **Adaptability**: New issues can be added or reprioritized without disrupting the workflow.
- **Visibility**: Everyone (even a solo developer) can see current task states and blockers at a glance.

By customizing our board with columns like **Testing** and **Blocked**, we aligned it with Agile best practices and made it more realistic for managing actual development and feedback cycles.
